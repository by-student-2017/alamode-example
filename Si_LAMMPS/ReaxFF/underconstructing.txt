I can not test it. This is because "sudo apt -y install lammps" do not work for reax in my case.

metal vs. real
different: time, velocity, force, etc

For style real, these are the units:
mass = grams/mole
distance = Angstroms
time = femtoseconds
energy = Kcal/mole
velocity = Angstroms/femtosecond
force = Kcal/mole-Angstrom
torque = Kcal/mole
temperature = Kelvin
pressure = atmospheres
dynamic viscosity = Poise
charge = multiple of electron charge (1.0 is a proton)
dipole = charge*Angstroms
electric field = volts/Angstrom
density = gram/cm^dim

For style metal, these are the units:
mass = grams/mole
distance = Angstroms
time = picoseconds
energy = eV
velocity = Angstroms/picosecond
force = eV/Angstrom
torque = eV
temperature = Kelvin
pressure = bars
dynamic viscosity = Poise
charge = multiple of electron charge (1.0 is a proton)
dipole = charge*Angstroms
electric field = volts/Angstrom
density = gram/cm^dim
